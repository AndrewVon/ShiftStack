This is a README file for the project ShiftStack.
Created by Feng Haoran @ 20170921

ShiftStack is a small tool written in Python, 
based on "sep" "astronomy-net" and "astropy" project.

With ShiftStack we can stack FITS images taken by telescopes,
and stack them with small position shifts depended on time.
So the signal from faint moving objects can be collected in
one single pixel, making it easier to detect.

This project is just starting up.
